            <p> Hola! I'm Fran Quero, a passionate advocate of open-source hardware and wetware, striving to create accessible 
                and production-ready tools that fuel biotechnology research for everyone. I have special focus on exploring how
                to enable distributed production of these tools, and, as a part of this exploration, I have created this platform 
                where you can geek around some designs and adquire the ones in stock. 
                As I am just starting out on this new venture please be patient and kind:)
            </p>
